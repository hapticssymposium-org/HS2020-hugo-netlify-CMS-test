Toward haptic deepening of affective connections: From neuroscience to design","description":"Touch is personal and emotional. It provides the most intuitive and potent way we can express romantic or parental love, comfort a friend, calm a childâ€™s jitters, and soothe or take comfort from a pet. Our first sense to develop, social touch is key to the well-being of the young, infirm or aged, as nurses well know; therapists rely on touch-based interventions in their interactions with children who are sensory-seeking or on the autism spectrum. Over the last decade, emerging academic and industry knowledge about affective touch has spanned neuroscience, psychology, engineering, physical therapy, entertainment and more. \n\nThis Cross-Cutting Challenge will describe this emerging area, which may be key to unlocking a wide array of meaningful haptic applications. To pursue major advances, it is vital that researchers spanning this disparate space come together, especially to leverage advances in science with advances in engineered systems and technologies. A wide range of perspectives will address two main questions:","objects":{"entry":{"path":"site/content/presenting/ccc-theme-2.md","sha":"c04341d4bea0d4c8797a8a5750db11f9c7b36ac0"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-11-13T19:13:33.154Z"}
