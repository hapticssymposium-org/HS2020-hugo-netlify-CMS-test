We have a dedicated email list to distribute infrequent but important information about the 2018 IEEE Haptics Symposium.

We anticipate sending less than 20 messages to this list between July 2017 and March 2018.  Only a handful of these emails will be distributed more broadly.

If you want to join this Haptics Symposium email list, simply follow these steps:

1. \    Visit the https://listserv.ieee.org/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=haptics&A=1
2. \    Enter your email address into the form
3. \    Click "Subscribe (HAPTICS)"
4. \    Click the confirmation link that will be emailed to you

This same link also allows you to unsubscribe from the list and update the way you receive messages (digest or one at a time).

If you have any comments or questions about this email list, please contact chairs@hapticssymposium.org.
