# Awards

Four awards will be distributed at IEEE Haptics Symposium 2020 to honor top contributions in each of the main categories of short IEEE Transactions on Haptics papers, technical papers, video presentations, and WIP papers. Given the virtual format of the conference, no award was given for hands-on demonstrations.  

The details of each award appear below.  All winners will be announced during the award ceremony portion of the livestream event on June 25, 2020, and they will be listed below shortly thereafter.

## Best IEEE Transactions on Haptics Short Paper

Thirty-six of the papers presented at the conference were published as short papers in the IEEE Transactions on Haptics (ToH).  The ToH Editor-in-Chief, Lynette Jones, selected six papers to be considered for this inaugural award based on the strength of the reviews they received.  The authors of all six papers submitted video presentations, which will be shown in the livestream event.

A committee of three experts will select the winner of this award based on the final manuscripts, any supplementary materials, the anonymized reviews, and the video presentations.  The winner of the award will receive a monetary prize of $1000, sponsored by [Force Dimension](http://www.forcedimension.com).  If any are selected, each honorable mention will receive $500.
