# Awards

Four main awards were distributed at IEEE Haptics Symposium 2020 to honor top contributions in each of the main categories of IEEE Transactions on Haptics short papers, technical papers, video presentations, and WIP papers. Commendations were also conferred for outstanding reviewing of technical paper submissions.  Given the virtual format of the conference, no awards were given for hands-on demonstrations.  

The details of each award appear below.  All winners were announced during the award ceremony portion of the [livestream event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h-9czaJmOY) on June 25, 2020, which is also archived for online viewing.  In addition to the listed monetary prizes, each winning team received a commemorative certificate by mail.

## Best IEEE Transactions on Haptics Short Paper

Thirty-six of the papers presented at the conference were published as short papers in the IEEE Transactions on Haptics (ToH).  The ToH Editor-in-Chief, Lynette Jones, selected six of these papers to be considered for this inaugural award based on the strength of the reviews they received.  The authors of all six ToH short paper award finalists submitted video presentations that are [available online](https://2020.hapticssymposium.org/program/video-presentations/) and were also shown in the [livestream event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h-9czaJmOY).

A committee of three experts (Katherine J. Kuchenbecker, Vincent Lévesque, and Hiroyuki Shinoda) selected the winner of this award based on the final manuscripts, any supplementary materials, the anonymized reviews, and the video presentations.  In addition to the winner, they selected one first honorable mention and one second honorable mention.

## Best Video Presentation

In lieu of oral presentations, authors of all ToH short papers and technical papers were invited to prepare and submit a three-minute-long video presentation.  Almost all authors provided such a video, which can be accessed on the [video presentations page](https://2020.hapticssymposium.org/program/video-presentations/) of this website.

This award will be selected through a community-based voting process.  Each person associated with IEEE Haptics Symposium 2020 has the right to vote, including registrants, co-authors of all types of contributions, student volunteers, and members of the Organizing Committee, Program Committee, and Conference Editorial Board.  Individuals are asked not to vote for videos produced by their own research team.  The details of the voting process were distributed by email on June 13, and votes are due by June 19.  

A committee of three experts will tally the votes and select the winner and any possible honorable mentions based on the votes received.  The winner of the award will receive a monetary prize sponsored by [Facebook Reality Labs](https://www.facebook.com/careers/life/facebook-reality-labs-turning-ideas-into-realities).  If any are selected, each honorable mention will receive a smaller monetary prize.  These selected video presentations will also be shown in the livestream event.

## Most Exciting Work-in-progress Paper

A total of forty-four work-in-progress (WIP) papers were accepted for the conference.  The Haptics Symposium 2020 WIP Chair, Heather Culbertson, selected four papers to be considered for this award based on the strength of the reviews they received.  The authors of all four of these WIP papers submitted short video presentations, which will be shown in the livestream event.

A committee of four experts will select the winner of this award based on the final manuscripts, the anonymized reviews, and the video presentations.

## Outstanding Reviewers

The Haptics Symposium publication process critically depends on careful and constructive expert review of submitted manuscripts.  Individuals who reviewed IEEE Transactions on Haptics short papers are eligible for the journal’s annual reviewing awards, while individuals who reviewed at least one technical paper submission are eligible for this commendation from the conference.

After the review of all technical papers was complete, the Haptics Symposium 2020 Editor-in-Chief, Veronica Santos, invited all members of the Program Committee to nominate reviewers for this prize.  A subset of the Best Technical Paper Award Committee looked over the reviews submitted by each nominee and selected the winners.  Each recipient will receive a small monetary prize.
