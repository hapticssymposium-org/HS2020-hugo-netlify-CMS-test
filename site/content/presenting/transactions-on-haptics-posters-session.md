# Transactions on Haptics Posters Session
Authors of articles recently published in the IEEE Transactions on Haptics are invited to present their work in an interactive session during the conference. This is a great occasion for journal authors to engage with other scientists and reach a larger audience!

## Important Dates

ToH poster submission deadline:       **January 29, 2020**

ToH poster acceptance notification:      **January 31, 2020**

## Participation Criteria

The invitation is open for all articles that have been published in the IEEE Transactions on Haptics in 2019 (Volume 12, issues 1-4), plus all ToH articles that are available on IEEE Xplore via Early Access before the application deadline.

Articles reporting research that was presented at a conference in an earlier form may (and are encouraged to) participate in this interactive session. Articles that were presented during the Transactions on Haptics interactive session at the IEEE World Haptics Conference 2019, however, are not eligible to participate.

At least one of the articleâ€™s authors must register for the conference.

## Submission Instructions

To participate, one author should send an email with the full citation of their Transactions on Haptics article to the ToH Posters Chair (Ilana Nisky) at [tohp [at] hapticssymposium.org](mailto:tohp@hapticssymposium.org)  by **11:59 p.m. (PST) on January 29, 2020**.

In the unlikely event that there is insufficient space, articles published in 2019 will be given priority over Early Access articles, since Early Access articles may be eligible to participate in similar events at future haptics conferences.

Acceptance in the poster session will be confirmed by January 31, 2019.

## Presentation Instructions
All ToH articles will be presented during a reception from 16:30 to 18:00 on Sunday, March 29. 

The ToH posters session will not be held in parallel with any podium or demo sessions, and only ToH articles and industrial exhibitions will be presented during this time.

More specific instructions will be posted closer to the event.

## Contact

Any questions and suggestions about this presentation opportunity can be addressed to the ToH Posters Chair (Ilana Nisky) at [tohp [at] hapticssymposium.org](mailto:tohp@hapticssymposium.org).
