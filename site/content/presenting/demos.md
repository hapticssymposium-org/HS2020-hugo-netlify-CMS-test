Submission of hands-on demonstrations is open to all members of the haptics research community.

Paper Format

November 29, 2019 – Demo submissions open

January 26, 2020 – Demo submission deadline

February 9, 2020 – Demo acceptance notification

Submission Method

Proposals for hands-on demonstrations will be submitted electronically via our PrecisionConference system. Select the "Haptics Symposium" Society, "Haptics 2020" Conference, and "Haptics 2020 Demonstrations" Track.

Each submission will include the following items:

A title that succinctly describes the demonstration.

An ordered list of authors (including first and last names), with an indication of who is the corresponding author.

A 100-word abstract describing the hands-on demonstration in more detail.

An image that can be used in the conference digest. The image should have a square aspect ratio and contain at least 900 pixels by 900 pixels, in JPEG or PNG format, with a file size less than 2 MB.

Any special considerations that the conference organizers should be aware of.

It is also highly recommended that authors submit a supplemental video. Videos will be used for promotional purposes at the conference, and all videos will be compiled in a single one that will be posted on the conference website to showcase current research in haptics. When submitting a video, please follow these guidelines: format (mpeg, 4m, mp4), length (up to 2 minutes), resolution (at least 480p progressive scan), and file size (up to 40 MB).

Review Process

Submissions will be reviewed by the Demos & Exhibits Co-Chairs to ensure all demos are of interest to conference attendees and free from commercial content.

Publication

The submitted title, author list, abstract, image, and video will be included in the electronic proceedings distributed to conference attendees but not archived on IEEExplore.

Demonstration Details

Demonstrations will be assigned to specific sessions on Monday, March 29, and Tuesday, March 30, in which authors are required to be near their demo to engage in interactive discussions with other conference attendees.

Demonstration authors are encouraged to bring a poster to accompany their demo.

Each demonstration will be assigned a space at the conference. The space will include a table, chairs, electrical power, and poster board.

Logistics

Each demo will be allocated a space that includes a 72" by 30" (183 cm by 76 cm) table, two chairs, one six-outlet power strip (120 V, 60 Hz, type B North America plugs), and a 8' by 4' (2.4 m by 1.2 m) board for mounting a poster. Demo presenters are invited to set up their demos on Sunday, March 28 after 7:00 p.m. Demos should be removed by 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday, March 31 (the last day of the conference).
