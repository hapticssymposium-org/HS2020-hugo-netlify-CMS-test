**NEW INITIATIVE: IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HAPTICS SHORT PAPERS**

More information is available at <https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/toh>

The 2020 conference has added a new, early submission option (deadline: **September 27, 2019**) for technical papers that authors wish to be considered for presentation at Haptics Symposium and simultaneous publication in IEEE Transactions on Haptics, as short papers. 

Authors may submit their 6-page paper to this new track via the Transactions on Haptics website.  Papers should be prepared using the Transactions on Haptics template (not the conference template).  Each paper will be reviewed by Transactions on Haptics reviewers and an Associate Editor.  The outcome of the first round of reviews will be "accept", "major revision", or "reject". For papers receiving a decision of “major revision” after the first review round, authors will need to submit a revision within 30 days for a second review, which may result in a decision of “accept” or “reject.”  If the decision after the Transactions on Haptics review is “accept,” the paper will be included in the conference and simultaneously published in the journal.

Any papers that receive a decision of “reject” after review by Transactions on Haptics will be evaluated for inclusion by the Haptics Symposium Conference Editorial Board, which will have access to the reviews and Associate Editor’s report.  A paper may therefore be rejected from the journal but accepted for the conference. Such papers will be published in the conference proceedings rather than in the journal.  A paper may also be rejected for publication by both the journal and the conference.  Those papers that are accepted for publication in the journal will be included in the conference, where they will be presented by authors, and will be simultaneously published in the journal.

Authors choosing not to submit via the new journal track may still submit their papers directly to the conference where they will be reviewed following the usual procedure.  If accepted, such papers will be published in the conference proceedings.
