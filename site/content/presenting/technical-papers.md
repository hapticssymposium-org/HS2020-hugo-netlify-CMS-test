# Technical Papers in Conference Proceedings

We solicit technical papers that report original, novel, unpublished work relevant to all the scientific, technological, and application aspects of haptics.

## **Paper Format**

Technical papers should be prepared according to the formatting instructions available [here](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/support.php).

For authors' convenience, the templates for technical papers can be downloaded in [Word](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/word.php) or [Latex](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php) format. Note that only the US Letter template will be accepted, not the A4 template.

## **Paper Length**

Authors should aim for a technical paper length of 6 pages or less, including references and all other components of the paper.

1 or 2 extra pages (beyond 6 pages) may added through a charge of $200 per page, paid during conference registration.

## **Author Names and Affiliations**

Submitted papers will be reviewed in single-blind manner.

Author names and affiliations should be specified in all technical papers.

## **Submission Due Date**

~~20~~ **25** October, 2019 (11:59 p.m. Pacific Time)

## **Submission Method**

All technical papers (with optional videos) should be submitted using [PrecisionConference](https://new.precisionconference.com/haptics) (submission system will be open on 28 September, 2019).  Select the "Haptics Symposium" Society, "Haptics 2020" Conference, and "Haptics 2020 Technical Papers" Track. 

## **Presentation and Publication**

All accepted technical papers will be presented orally in a podium presentation, either in a dual-track regular session or in a single-track featured session.

All accepted papers will be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings and also published in IEEE Xplore.

Paper copyright will be transferred to the IEEE as part of the publication process.

Paper decisions will be announced on December 23, 2019, and will also be available in [PrecisionConference](https://new.precisionconference.com/haptics).

## **Videos**

Submission of videos is optional but strongly encouraged to help readers understand the paper.

Uploaded videos will be reviewed along with the paper.

Videos will be submitted for publication to IEEE Xplore and may be used to promote the conference.

Guidelines: format (mpeg 4, .mp4), length (up to 2 minutes), resolution (at least 480p progressive scan), and file size (up to 40 MB).  Final (but not initial) video submissions will need to include some simple additional files for IEEE Xplore compliance.

## **Final Submission**

All accepted technical papers will appear in this year's Haptics Symposium proceedings, which will be distributed at the conference and submitted to IEEE Xplore.

The contact author of each accepted technical paper will receive final paper submission instructions by email. Note that a 100-word abstract is not required.  We encourage optional submission of a high-resolution square image that represents the main contribution of the paper; this image will be used in the online proceedings.

Please carefully follow the instructions provided in that email. Author teams who already submitted their final paper via PCS must resubmit following the instructions in the email; no final papers can be accepted via PCS this year.

Due date for all items: January, 2020

Respond to the email you received or contact the publication chair at publications@hapticssymposium.org with questions about final submission of technical papers.

## **Presentation Instructions**

One author from each technical paper will deliver the oral presentation in the time permitted. Further details will be provided at a later time.

All presentations will be delivered from the speaker's own laptop computer to ensure the correct appearance of the slides. Please bring any required video adapters.  Both HDMI and VGA connections will be available, as well as audio output.

Authors can determine their presentation room and time from the detailed conference program.  (We ask that authors check the schedule again once the conference has begun to ensure they have the most up-to-date information.)

Presenters should check the connection with the conference projection system during a break before the session in which they are presenting, making sure all videos play on the screen.  Our on-site technician will be able to assist you with any issues.

We ask that all presenters arrive for their session at least ten minutes before it begins, check in with the session chairs, and sit near the front of the room to facilitate the change between speakers.
