# Author Instructions for Video Presentation Preparation

**Deadline: May 20, 2020**

The authors of each technical paper or IEEE Transactions on Haptics Short Paper are invited and strongly encouraged to prepare a video presentation of their paper. The videos will be disseminated via the [IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YjMwrg8Hk6uAtyWb62yAw/), and will be organized into thematic playlists reflecting the originally planned conference program.  We believe that this collection of online videos will provide a valuable resource for people around the world to learn about new advances in haptics, and for the contributions from the conference to be disseminated widely via social media.

All contributed video presentations will be eligible for the conference Best Video Presentation Award, which will be announced during the 2020 Haptics Symposium live streaming event in late June, 2020. **To be eligible for the Best Video Presentation award, authors must upload their video before the deadline of May 20.**

## Please carefully follow these instructions for preparing your video presentation:

Your video should consist of a recorded oral presentation by one of the authors, consistent with community standards for conference oral presentations

**Video presentation format:**

* Recommended: full-screen screencast of the slides, with a picture-in-picture video of the presenter
* Acceptable Alternatives: full screen of slides with audio of speaker or slides and speaker video side-by-side.
* Total video duration: 3 minutes
* Use a high quality microphone for the recording.  Most headset microphones work well.  Avoid using the microphone that is integrated in your computer.
* The video resolution should be at least 720p (1280x720).  We prefer 1080p (1920x1080) and 60 fps.
* Authors must upload their video to **their own YouTube account** (authors may create a new account for this purpose if they wish or use their existing account).  
* Recommended: Upload closed caption subtitles with your video
* Please check the quality of the uploaded video and sound and your ability to access the video from a private browser window.

**Configure the following settings under “Edit Video” on the YouTube page for your video:**

* Set the visibility for your presentation video to “public”
* Recommended: select the “allow embeddings” feature using “More Options” within the “Edit Video” page.

**Set the title for your video as follows:**

_\[LastNameOfFirstAuthor et al.], \[ShortenedPaperTitle], 2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium_

_For example:_

_Smith et al., Vibrotactile Massage in Virtual Reality, IEEE Haptics Symposium 2020_

**Write the description of your video as follows:**

_\[AuthorName1], \[AuthorName2], ... , \[FullPaperTitle], Proceedings of IEEE Haptics Symposium 2020_

_\[DOI in URL form - will be available via IEEE Xplore in coming weeks, please update as needed]_

_\[Abstract Text as Published in Paper]_

_\#haptics #haptics2020 <optionally other keyword hashtags as appropriate>_

_https://www.hapticssymposium.org/_

For example:

_Abstract: Many researchers have sought to introduce vibrotactile massage methods in virtual reality.  However, prior approaches have proved inadequate.  Here, we show ..._
