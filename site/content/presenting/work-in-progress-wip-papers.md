# **Work-in-Progress (WIP) Papers**

Work-in-Progress papers enable authors to share late-breaking results with the research community. The emphasis of WIP papers is on the novelty of the work, not completeness. 

## Paper Format

WIP papers should be prepared according to the formatting instructions available [here](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/support.php).

For authors' convenience, the templates for technical papers can be downloaded in [Word](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/word.php) or [Latex](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php) format. Note that only the US Letter template will be accepted, not the A4 template.

## Paper Length

WIP papers should be 2 pages including references.

One extra page (for a total of 3 pages) may be added through a charge of $200, paid during conference registration.

## Author Names and Affiliations

Submitted papers will be reviewed in single-blind manner.

Author names and affiliations should be specified on all WIP papers.

## Submission Method

All WIP papers (including optional video) should be submitted using PrecisionConference.  Select the "Haptics Symposium" Society, "Haptics 2020" Conference, and "Haptics 2020 WIP Papers" Track.



Publication

All accepted WIP papers will be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings, but they will not be published in IEEE Xplore.

Authors retain the full copyright of WIP papers so that they can submit a more mature version of the paper at another time.

Presentation



All WIP papers will be presented in a single-track poster session that will take place in the evening on Monday, March 26.  Details about the WIP poster session are listed below.

The WIP poster session will not be held in parallel with any podium or demo sessions, and only WIP posters will be presented during this time.

Authors of accepted WIP papers will be invited to briefly introduce their work during the WIP teaser session on the same day of the conference. Details about the WIP teaser session are listed below.

Presenters will need to design and print their own poster. 

Videos



Submission of a video is optional but encouraged to help readers understand the WIP paper.

Uploaded videos will be reviewed along with the paper.

Videos associated with accepted WIP papers will be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings and may be used to promote the conference.

Guidelines: format (mpeg 4, .mp4), length (up to 60 seconds), resolution (at least 480p progressive scan), and file size (up to 20 MB).
