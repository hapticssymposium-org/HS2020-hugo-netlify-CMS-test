## **Haptics Symposium Health Information**

We the organizers of the 2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium would like to express our deepest concern for those who are being affected by the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak around the world.  We want to let you know that we have been closely monitoring the situation and its implications for conference attendees and stakeholders.  **We want to let everyone know that the conference will take place as planned.** 

Unfortunately, a small number of participants from affected areas with enforced travel prohibitions have cancelled.  Those affected so far are primarily based in China.  We are providing alternative means for authors to have their work presented and published if they are unable to attend due to travel prohibitions.  Authors that are unable to attend due to travel restrictions may request that another member of our community present on their behalf.  We ask the broader community to be open to this possibility, and to please offer assistance to any affected colleagues as you become aware.

We are in close contact with the venue host, the Crystal Gateway Marriott. They have assured us that they are taking steps to ensure a healthy meeting environment, including cleaning all surfaces at more frequent intervals, installing disinfection stations, and shampooing carpets.

We are not aware of any confirmed Covid infections in Virginia or Washington D.C. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has set up a website with valuable information to assist people with concerns about the Coronavirus, including information on transmission, symptoms, prevention, and treatment: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html 

The CDC recommends the following steps to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses (including influenza â€” it is flu season):

* Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
* Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
* Stay home when you are sick.
* Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
* Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

Before traveling to the conference, we recommend that you stay informed of any information your local health agencies may make available and take reasonable precautions to protect yourself.    We, as well as the IEEE more broadly, will continue to closely monitor this dynamic situation and will provide updates with any developments.

We sincerely hope that this situation improves soon, especially for all of those currently affected, and that all of you remain healthy. We look forward to seeing you soon at the 2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium.

## **Information authors affected by travel prohibitions**

If you are an author affected by travel prohibitions due to the Coronavirus, we would like to make alternative options available for presenting your work at the conference.  Please see the instructions listed below, as appropriate for different types of contributions.  If you wish to take advantage of these options, we ask affected authors to notify us **no later than Wednesday, March 11.** 

For authors that are unable to attend, please see the instructions below, as regard the various types of contributions:

**Technical papers (both ToH Short Papers and HS conference technical papers):** All papers will be published (on the USB drive to be distributed to conference attendees and IEEE Xplore) and listed in the program.  In addition, we would like to ensure that there is the opportunity for oral presentation of the work at the conference.  The ideal option, if the original author cannot attend, would be that authors recruit a colleague to present the work on their behalf.  Authors are also welcome to contact the conference organizers (chairs@hapticssymposium.org), who can attempt to recommend alternative presenters for the author to contact.  Another option that we can accommodate is to allow authors to create a 2-3 minute video to be played at the conference during the planned session.  If you would like to do this, we ask that you contact the conference organizers.  We cannot offer remote presentations via teleconference due to logistical challenges.

**WIP posters / ToH posters:** We will continue to publish the WIP papers (on the USB drive to be distributed to conference attendees) and will list information for WIP and ToH posters in the program.  We would also like to ensure that your poster can be presented at the conference.  One option would be to send your poster to a colleague to print, bring to the conference, and present on your behalf at the relevant poster session.  A second option would be to create a poster to be displayed (without an accompanying presenter) at the conference.  Authors wishing to use this second option should contact the conference organizers (chairs@hapticssymposium.org).

**Demos:** Unfortunately, hands-on demonstrations cannot be presented remotely.  Any demonstration for which cannot authors cannot attend will unfortunately be cancelled and will be omitted from the program.  We encourage demonstration authors to resubmit their work to either the 2020 Eurohaptics or the 2020 IEEE World Haptics Conference.

**PLEASE NOTE:** For authors who will take advantage of one of the aforementioned options, **we require that at least one of the co-authors of the work register for at least 1-day of the conference (per paper or other contribution) to help defray conference costs,** especially the associated publication costs. 

If you are an author who is unable to attend due to travel prohibitions, please email the conference organizers (chairs@hapticssymposium.org) with the following information:

* If you have arranged for a colleague to present your paper or poster, please provide their name and contact information.
* Please provide the information as to which authors are registering for which paper or poster.

## **Information regarding the presentation of demos**

For years, the presentation of hands-on demonstrations have been vital to our community.  We are planning to continue to host demonstrations this year, but due to their often hands-on nature, we are crafting precautionary steps to minimize health concerns.  In particular, we will 

Provide for each demo booth, a 75% alcohol rub sanitizer (hand gel) as well as alcohol wipes and/or spray.  Surfaces will be cleaned between participants.  Such sanitization procedures have been deemed effective by the World Health Organization.

For those demo participants who utilize virtual reality headsets, we will provide appropriate disposable liners or masks.
