Re: Postponement of 2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium



Dear Haptics Symposium Participants and Broader Community,

IEEE has been monitoring the developing Coronavirus, COVID-2019.

The safety and well-being of all conference participants is our priority. After studying and evaluating the announcements, guidance, and news released by relevant national departments, we are sorry to announce that the 2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium, scheduled to be held from 28 â€“ 31 March, in Washington, DC, U.S.A. will be postponed to a later date to be determined.

We will provide more information on the new logistical details over the next couple of weeks. We thank you for your understanding and patience, especially due to the uncertain nature of the COVID-19 virus situation. Our goal is to arrive at the best solution to enable us to get the most out of this event, and there are many factors to consider.

We anticipate that those who planned to attend in March may have questions about matters such as registration fees and publication of the conference technical papers.  Please know that we are working on this as diligently and rapidly as possible.  Rest assured that all of the papers that went through the review process will be published at a date to be determined.

Again, we apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.  Thank you for your patience as we navigate this complex situation.

Greg Gerling and Yon Visell

2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium General Co-Chairs
