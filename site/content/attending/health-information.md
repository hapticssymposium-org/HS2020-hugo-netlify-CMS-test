## **Haptics Symposium Health Information**

Please know that our thoughts are with those affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The health and safety of our members and participants are our first priority.  We are closely monitoring any specific travel advisories through official channels, which include the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. State Department.

The 2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium which is scheduled to take place, as planned, 28 – 31 March, in Washington, DC U.S.A. 

Before traveling to the conference, we recommend that you stay informed of any information your local health agencies may make available and take reasonable precautions to protect yourself. IEEE continues to closely monitor this dynamic situation and will provide updates with any developments.

The following proactive steps are being taken to maintain a safe and healthy environment at the 2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium:

* We are committed to following regional jurisdiction guidelines and rules in maintaining a safe environment for our attendees.  The World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidelines are located here.
* We are working closely with the Crystal Gateway Marriott in Washington, DC and surrounding venues hosting official The IEEE Haptics Symposium programming to ensure there are sufficient medical processes in place and sanitation products readily available.
* We are supporting individuals who may be unable to travel to The IEEE Haptics Symposium from affected regions.
* We will continue to provide timely WHO and other relevant updates to registered attendees throughout the conference as needed.  

We will support our community and authors that are unable to attend due to travel restrictions may request that another member of our community present on their behalf.

The CDC recommends the following steps to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses (including influenza — it is flu season):

* Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
* Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
* Stay home when you are sick.
* Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
* Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

We look forward to seeing you soon at the 2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium.



## **Information for authors unable to attend the Symposium in person**

If you are an author affected by travel restrictions, we have alternative options available for presenting your work. Please see the instructions listed below, as appropriate for different types of contributions. If you wish to take advantage of these options, **we ask affected authors to notify us no later than Wednesday, March 11.**

**Technical papers (both ToH Short Papers and HS conference technical papers):** All accepted papers will be published at the conference (on the USB drive to be distributed to conference attendees and submitted to IEEE Xplore) and listed in the program. We will also afford authors the opportunity for oral presentation of the work at the conference. The preferred option, if the original author cannot attend, would be that authors recruit a colleague to present the work on their behalf. Authors are also welcome to contact the conference organizers (chairs@hapticssymposium.org), who can attempt to recommend alternative presenters for the author to contact. Another option that we can accommodate is to allow authors to create a 2-3 minute video to be played at the conference during the planned session. If you would like to do this, we ask that you contact the conference organizers. We cannot offer remote presentations via teleconference due to logistical challenges.

**WIP posters / ToH posters:** We will continue to publish the WIP papers (on the USB drive to be distributed to conference attendees) and will list information for WIP and ToH posters in the program. We would also like to ensure that your poster can be presented at the conference. One option would be to send your poster to a colleague to print, bring to the conference, and present on your behalf at the relevant poster session. A second option would be to create a poster to be displayed (without an accompanying presenter) at the conference. Authors wishing to use this second option should contact the conference organizers (chairs@hapticssymposium.org).

**Demos:** Unfortunately, hands-on demonstrations cannot be presented remotely. Any demonstration authors cannot attend will unfortunately be cancelled and omitted from the program. We encourage demonstration authors to resubmit their work to either the 2020 Eurohaptics or the 2021 IEEE World Haptics Conference.

**PLEASE NOTE: For authors who will take advantage of one of the aforementioned options, we require that at least one of the co-authors of the work register for at least 1-day of the conference (per paper or other contribution) to help defray conference costs.**

If you are an author who is unable to attend due to travel prohibitions, please email the conference organizers (chairs@hapticssymposium.org) with the following information:

* If you have arranged for a colleague to present your paper or poster, please provide their name and contact information.
* Please provide the information as to which authors are registering for which paper or poster.



## **Information regarding the presentation of demos**

For years, the presentation of hands-on demonstrations has been vital to our community. We are planning to continue to host demonstrations this year, but due to their often hands-on nature, we are crafting precautionary steps to minimize health concerns. In particular, we will

Provide for each demo booth, a 75% alcohol rub sanitizer (hand gel) as well as alcohol wipes and/or spray. Surfaces will be cleaned between participants. Such sanitization procedures have been deemed effective by the World Health Organization.

For those demo participants who utilize virtual reality headsets, we will provide appropriate disposable liners or masks.
