**Postponement of 2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium**


Dear Haptics Symposium Participants and Broader Community,

IEEE has been monitoring the developing Coronavirus, COVID-2019, situation.

The safety and well-being of all conference participants is our main priority. After studying and evaluating the announcements, guidance, and news released by relevant national organizations, we are sorry to announce that the 2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium, scheduled to be held from 28 â€“ 31 March, in Washington, DC, U.S.A. will be postponed to a later date, to be determined.

We will provide further information on the new logistical details in the next weeks. We thank you for your understanding and patience, especially in view of the uncertain nature of the COVID-19 virus situation. Our goal is to develop a conference event plan that will respect the safety and well-being of the community, and will provide the most benefit to the haptics community. There are many factors to consider.

We anticipate that those who planned to attend in March may have questions about matters such as registration fees and publication of the papers.  Please know that we are working on this as diligently and rapidly as possible.  Rest assured that all  papers that have gone through the review process will be published at a date to be determined.

Again, we apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.  Thank you for your patience as we navigate this complex situation.  Our sympathies go out to all of those who are affected by the Coronavirus situation.

Greg Gerling and Yon Visell

2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium General Co-Chairs
