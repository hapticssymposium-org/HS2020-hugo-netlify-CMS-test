**Making Hotel Reservations**

Getting the conference presentation venue is only possible if the attendees stay at the conference hotel.  We are required to fill our room allocation, and very much need for all attendees to stay here.  With exact monetary details to be announced later, we will be offering **significantly discounted** registration to attendees who stay in the conference hotel.

A dedicated website is now available for our attendees to book their hotel rooms online. Reservations can be made starting June 21, 2019 at this web address:
