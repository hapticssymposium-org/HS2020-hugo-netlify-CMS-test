Welcome to IEEE Haptics Symposium 2020!

Held since 1992, the IEEE Haptics Symposium is a vibrant interdisciplinary forum where psychophysicists, engineers, and designers come together to share advances, spark new collaborations, and envision a future that benefits from rich physical interactions between humans and computers, generated through haptic (force and tactile) devices.  

The 2018 conference included two cross-cutting challenge sessions, 57 oral presentations of technical papers, 37 poster presentations of recent IEEE Transactions on Haptics articles, 32 poster presentations of work-in-progress papers, 36 hands-on demonstrations, many industry exhibits, a delicious banquet, technical tours of haptics labs at Stanford University, and much more!  Learn more via the compact program overview, the detailed online program, the iOs Confero app, the Android Confero app, and the symposium proceedings.  Registered conference attendees can access the papers and proceedings using credentials shared by email.

The 2020 conference has lots of information to come!
