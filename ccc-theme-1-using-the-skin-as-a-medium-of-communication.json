In addition to these systems that were developed for individuals with hearing and/or visual impairments, over the years there have been a number of attempts to develop tactile vocabularies and displays for general use. \n\nTopics addressed by the speakers will include: how should language be encoded on the skin, should such encoding be the same for speech and text, how does the location of the display influence the parameters available for use in communication, do multisensory cutaneous displays enhance learning and lead to better outcomes, what are the challenges in creating refreshable braille displays and other display technology for individuals who are visually impaired?","objects":{"entry":{"path":"site/content/presenting/ccc-theme-1-using-the-skin-as-a-medium-of-communication.md","sha":"6cf3b3aacda9211ef02be21bec00e8fab3f538ca"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-11-13T19:00:55.385Z"}
